-- * The CPS styntax

-- | A program is defined as a lambda abstraction. The calling convention is
-- that the program has one paramater, the final continuation.
type Prog = Lambda

-- | Labels are used throughout the code to refer to various positions in the code.
--
-- Integers are used here, but they are wrapped in a newtype to hide them from
-- the implementation.
newtype Label = Label Integer
    deriving (Show, Num, Eq, Ord)

-- | Variable names are just strings. Again, they are wrapped so they can be
-- treated abstractly.
newtype Var = Var String
    deriving (IsString, Show, Eq, Ord)

-- | A lambda expression has a label, a list of abstract argument names and a body.
data Lambda = Lambda Label [Var] Call
    deriving (Show)

-- | The body of a lambda expression is either 
data Call = App Label Val [Val]
          -- ^ an application of a value to a list of arguments, or
          | Let Label [(Var, Lambda)] Call
          -- ^ it is the definition of a list of (potentially mutable
          -- recursive) lambda expression, defined for a nother call
          -- expression.
    deriving (Show)

-- | A value can either be
data Val = L Lambda          -- ^ a lambda abstraction,
         | R Label Label Var -- ^ a reference to a variable (which contains the
                             -- label of the binding position of the variable
                             -- for convenience),
         | C Label Const     -- ^ a constant value or
         | P Prim            -- ^ a primitive operation.
    deriving (Show)

-- | As constants we only have integers.
type Const = Integer

-- | Primitive operations. The primitive operations are annotated by labels. These mark the (invisible) call sites that call the continuations, and are one per continuation.
data Prim = Plus Label -- ^ Integer addition. Expected parameters: two integers, one continuation.
          | If Label Label -- ^ Conditional branching. Expected paramters: one integer, one continuation to be called if the argument is nonzero, one continuation to be called if the argument is zero (“false”)
    deriving (Show)
