-- * Types

-- | A closure is a lambda expression bound to a binding environment
type Closure c = (Lambda, BEnv c)

-- | The abstract semantics are parametrized by a (finite) set of contours.
-- Here, this is modeled via a type class.
class (Show c, Eq c, Ord c) => Contour c where
    initial :: c -- ^ The initial contour, used by evalCPS, but not used
    nb :: c -> Label -> c -- ^ Generating a new contour. This method has access
                          -- to the label of the current call site, in case it
                          -- wants to record this information. 

-- | A possible contour set, the singleton set. Shivers calls this 0CFA, but in
-- Haskell, types and constructor names have to start with an upper case
-- letter.
newtype CFA0 = CFA0 ()
    deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)

instance Contour CFA0 where
    initial = CFA0 ()
    nb _ _ = CFA0 ()

-- | A more detailed contour set, remembering the call site. 
newtype CFA1 = CFA1 Label
    deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)

instance Contour CFA1 where
    initial = CFA1 (-1)
    nb _ l = CFA1 l

-- | A binding environment maps the labels of 'Lambda' and 'Let' bindings to the
-- innermost contour generated for these expressions
type BEnv c = Label :⇀ c

-- | A variable environment maps variable names together with a contour to a
-- value. The second parameter is required to allow for different, shadowed
-- bindings of the same variable to coexist.
type VEnv c = Var :× c :⇀ D c

-- | Here, we do not care about values any more, only about procedures:
data Proc c = PC (Closure c) -- ^ A closed lambda expression
            | PP Prim        -- ^ A primitive operation
            | Stop
    deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)


-- | For variables, we only remember the set of possible program values. We use
-- a list here instead of a set for the more convenient sytanx (list
-- comprehension etc.).
type D c = [Proc c]

-- | The origin of an edge in the control graph is a call position bundled with
-- the binding environment at that point.
type CCtxt c = Label :× BEnv c

-- | The resulting control flow graph has edges from call sites (annotated by
-- the current binding environment) to functions (e.g. lambdas with closure,
-- primitive operations, or 'Stop')
type CCache c = CCtxt c :⇀ D c

-- | The result of evaluating a program is an approximation to the control flow
-- graph.
type Ans c = CCache c

-- | The uncurried arguments of 'evalF'
type FState c = (Proc c, [D c], VEnv c, c)

-- | The uncurried arguments of 'evalC'
type CState c = (Call, BEnv c, VEnv c, c)

-- | We need memoization. This Data structure is used to remember all visited
-- arguments
type Memo c = Set (Either (FState c) (CState c))


-- * Evaluation functions

--   passing the Stop continuation to the outermost lambda

evalCPS_CFA0 = evalCPS

evalCPS_CFA1 :: Prog -> Ans CFA1

-- | evalC (called A by Shivers) evaluates a syntactical value to a semantical
--   piece of data.

evalV (L lam) β ve = [PC (lam, β)]

-- | evalF evaluates a function call, distinguishing between lambda
--   expressions, primitive operations and the special Stop continuation. It
--   calles 'evalC' for the function bodies.

--   Because we want to memoize the results of the recursive calls, and do not
--   want to separate that code, the that to be
